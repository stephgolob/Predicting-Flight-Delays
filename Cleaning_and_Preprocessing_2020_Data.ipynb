    "\n",
    "Flight delays in the United States cost airlines and passengers billions of dollars a year. According to the most recent statistics published in 2020 by the Federal Aviation Association (FAA), 54% of estimated flight delay costs were incurred by passengers. Furthermore, flight delays have a negative impact on the environment through increased fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Predicting flight delays would reduce emissions and the costs incurred by all parties. Ultimately improving productivity through a reduction in lost time and wages for passengers, saving the United States economy billions of dollars a year.\n",

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was downloaded from [The Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr). It consists of domestic flight data from the USA for all months of 2020. The data was downloaded by month and then concatenated to create a full 2020 data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initial exploratory data analysis I decided to focus on a subset of data to reduce noise from including too many airports and flights. I have chosen to focus on Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as it is the most popular origin airport in this data set (and the 2021 data set as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I perform some limited exploratory data analysis to remove columns with high percentages of missing values, check for duplicated values, and create a subset of data with ATL selected as the origin airport. I have also added weather data for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport downloaded from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00013874/detail)."
