    "The data was downloaded from [The Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr). It consists of domestic flight data from the USA for all months of 2021. The data was downloaded by month and then concatenated to create a full 2021 data set.\n",

    "After initial exploratory data analysis I decided to focus on a subset of data to reduce noise from including too many airports and flights. I have chosen to focus on Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as it is the most popular origin airport in this data set (and the 2020 data set as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I perform some limited exploratory data analysis to remove columns with high percentages of missing values, check for duplicated values, and create a subset of data with ATL selected as the origin airport. I have also added weather data for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport downloaded from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00013874/detail)."
